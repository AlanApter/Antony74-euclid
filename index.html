    <div id="defn1_1" class="pp">
        i. A point is that which has position but not dimensions.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_2" class="pp">
        ii. A line is length without breadth.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_3" class="pp">
        iii. The intersections of lines and their extremities are points.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_4" class="pp">
        iv. A line which lies evenly between its extreme points is called a straight or right line.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_5" class="pp">
        v. A surface is that which has length and breadth.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_6" class="pp">
        vi. When a surface is such that the right line joining any two arbitrary points in it lies
        wholly in the surface, it is called a plane.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_7" class="pp">
        vii. Any combination of points, of lines, or of points and lines in a plane, is called a plane figure.
        If a figure be formed of points only it is called a stigmatic figure; and if of right lines only,
        a rectilineal figure.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_8" class="pp">
        viii. Points which lie on the same right line are called collinear points. A figure formed of
        collinear points is called a row of points.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_9" class="pp">
        ix. The inclination of two right lines extending out from one point in different directions is
        called a rectilineal angle.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_10" class="pp">
        x. The two lines are called the legs, and the point the vertex of the angle.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_11" class="pp">
        xi. Designation of Angles.  A particular angle in a figure is denoted by three letters,
        as BAC of which the middle one, A, is at the vertex, and the other two along the legs.
        The angle is then read BAC.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_12" class="pp">
        xii. The angle formed by joining two or more angles together is called their sum.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_13" class="pp">
        xiii. When the sum of two angles BAC, CAD is such that the legs BA, AD form one right line,
        they are called supplements of each other.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_14" class="pp">
        xiv. When one line stands on another, and makes the adjacent angles at both sides of itself equal,
        each of the angles is called a right angle, and the line which stands on the other is called a
        perpendicular to it.  Hence a right angle is equal to its supplement.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_15" class="pp">
        xv. An acute angle is one which is less than a right angle.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_16" class="pp">
        xvi. An obtuse angle is one which is greater than a right angle.  The supplement of an acute
        angle is obtuse, and conversely, the supplement of an obtuse angle is acute.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_17" class="pp">
        xvii. When the sum of two angles is a right angle, each is called the complement of the other.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_18" class="pp">
        xviii. Three or more right lines passing through the same point are called concurrent lines.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_19" class="pp">
        xix. A system of more than three concurrent lines is called a pencil of lines.
        Each line of a pencil is called a ray, and the common point through which the rays pass is called the vertex.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_20" class="pp">
        xx. A triangle is a figure formed by three right lines joined end to end. The three lines are called its sides.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_21" class="pp">
        xxi. A triangle whose three sides are unequal is said to be scalene;  a triangle having two sides equal,
        to be isosceles; and and having all its sides equal, to be equilateral.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_22" class="pp">
        xxii. A right-angled triangle is one that has one of its angles a right angle. The side which
        subtends the right angle is called the hypotenuse.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_23" class="pp">
        xxiii. An obtuse-angled triangle is one that has one of its angles obtuse.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_24" class="pp">
        xxiv. An acute-angled triangle is one that has its three angles acute.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_25" class="pp">
        xxv. An exterior angle of a triangle is one that is formed by any side and the continuation of
        another side.  Hence a triangle has six exterior angles; and also each exterior angle is the
        supplement of the adjacent interior angle.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_26" class="pp">
        xxvi. A rectilineal figure bounded by more than three right lines is usually called a polygon.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_27" class="pp">
        xxvii. A polygon is said to be convex when it has no re-entrant angle.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_28" class="pp">
        xxviii. A polygon of four sides is called a quadrilateral.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_29" class="pp">
        xxix. A quadrilateral whose four sides are equal is called a lozenge.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_30" class="pp">
        xxx. A lozenge which has a right angle is called a square.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_31" class="pp">
        xxxi. A polygon which has five sides is called a pentagon; one which has six sides, a hexagon, and so on.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_32" class="pp">
        xxxii. A circle is a plane figure formed by a curved line called the circumference, and is such that
        all right lines drawn from a certain point within the figure to the circumference are equal to one
        another. This point is called the centre.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_33" class="pp">
        xxxiii. A radius of a circle is any right line drawn from the centre to the circumference.
    </div>
    <div id="defn1_34" class="pp">
        xxxiv. A diameter of a circle is a right line drawn through the centre and terminated both ways by
        the circumference.
