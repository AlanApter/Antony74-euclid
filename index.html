        <h3>Prop 1: On a given finite right line (AB) to construct an equilateral triangle.</h3>

        <div class="pp line1">With A as centre, and AB as radius, describe the circle BCD (Post. iii.).</div>

        <div class="pp line2">With B as centre, and BA as radius, describe the circle ACE, cutting the former circle in C.</div>

        <div class="pp line3">Join CA, CB (Post. i.).</div>

        <div class="pp line4">Then ABC is the equilateral triangle required.</div>

        <div class="pp line5">Because A is the centre of the circle BCD, AC is equal to AB (Def. xxxii.).</div>

        <div class="pp line6">Again, because B is the centre of the circle ACE, BC is equal to BA.</div>

        <div class="pp line7">
            Hence we have proved.<br/>
            AC = AB;<br/>
            and BC = AB
        </div>

        <div class="pp line8">
            But things which are equal to the same are equal to one another (Axiom i.);
            therefore AC is equal to BC;
        </div>

        <div class="pp line9">
            therefore the three lines AB, BC, CA are equal
            to one another. Hence the triangle ABC is equilateral (Def. xxi.); and it is
            described on the given line AB, which was required to be done.
